# wizarding-world

This repo contains all the files for my personal wizarding world website that i'm designing.

# introduction

The idea for this project was to create a Harry Potter themed website that introduces users to the Wizarding world and its characters and also to spells and magic used within the book series.

My sisters and I have grown up watching the films, reading the books and quizzing each other on our knowledge of the Harry Potter universe so I wanted to create something that we could use together.
